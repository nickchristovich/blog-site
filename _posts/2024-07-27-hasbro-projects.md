### Products I Worked on at Hasbro

Below is a list of many of the products I had some part in making during my time at Hasbro. I don't have enough pictures to warrant an entire post for most of these, and I don't think I should go into too much detail of the development process due to the confidential nature of the work at the time.

#### Furby

[Product Link](https://www.amazon.com/Furby-Accessories-Interactive-Activated-Animatronic/dp/B0BLR5RGPY?th=1)

Furby was released on June 22nd 2023. It features moving feet and ears, light up ears and face, and many voice activated behaviors and interactions. 

During development of Furby, I designed and built many low level prototypes to test out various feature ideas. I also worked extensively with the team that was performing the voice recognition training. Existing training data was not sufficient as we were targeting children as young as 6 with this product, so custom voice training data had to be gathered. I helped design and then perform a data gathering protocol, collecting voice recordings from close to 100 children.

#### Nerf Star Trek Phaser Blaster

[Product Link](https://www.hasbropulse.com/product/nerf-lmtd-star-trek-starfleet-type-3-and-type-2-phaser-blasters/F8203S210)

This Nerf blaster is a Hasbro Pulse item, meaning it was targeting a more mature fan audience than a normal blaster. It is designed to look similar to the iconic Star Trek Type 3 Phaser, but with corrupted Borg detailing. It was originally sold via preorder, then released on November 4th, 2023.

I pulled all of the initial sound effects for this blaster by scanning Star Trek episodes that featured the original prop, as well as pulling from some other sources. I also designed all of the initial lighting effects. These effects included ambient/idle animations, reload animations, and of course firing animations. Unfortunately my time at Hasbro ended before the development of this product was complete, so I'm not sure how much of my original work stuck around. I can tell from some product review videos that at least the essence of most of my work has made it into the final product.

#### Chandra Gauntlet

[Product Link](https://www.hasbropulse.com/product/magic-the-gathering-chandra-pyromancers-gauntlet-roleplay-collectible/F6130SE02)

This wearable gauntlet was released in November of 2023, geared towards collectors, fans, and cosplayers. It features mist and lighting effects to simulate the flamethrower gauntlet worn by Magic the Gathering character Chandra.

I designed all of the initial effects for this product including 3 modes and several different intensity levels. The most basic mode features only ambient lights meant for display. The main mode features a continuous stream of mist illuminated by LEDs. The mist, light, and sound level can be adjusted to several unique intensities. The final mode is 'fireball' where mist and lights are synchronized to create a fireball effect.

#### Nerf Gelfire Nightfall Hopper

I designed and built the original prototype for this product to test feasibility. It featured adjustable lighting so we could test different exposure times and intensity to maximize battery life and glow.

#### Misc.

I worked on plenty of other projects that I can't talk about in specifics, but I can share some general information. Other projects I worked on included:

- A large scale animatronic Ã  la [Butterscotch](https://furreal.fandom.com/wiki/Butterscotch_Pony) and [Kota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota_the_triceratops)

- A learning based toy that grows with a child from dexterity play to colors and counting

- A novel mechanized reload method for Nerf blasters

- Sound boxes for testing different levels of audio compression and speaker types

- Lighting demos 

- Numerous one-off electronics demos for emerging tech or brand manager concepts
